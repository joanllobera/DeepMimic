This installation guide works to run DeepMimics on a fresh Ubuntu20 installation.

It also assumes the use of anaconda to create the virtual environment (although not strictly needed).

---------------------------------
first version: 2023.02.09
reviewed with an installation form scratch:  2023.02.10

-------------------
considerations:
trying to install in ubuntu 22 is a nightmare due to the versions of python needed being very old.

when trying to install using Ubuntu 20, by default in Ubuntu python3.8 is installed.

Installing deepmimic using python3.8, which is the one build by default in Ubuntu 20. It builds, but then it does not work at runtime.


I therefore: install python 3.6, in ubuntu 20.


--------------------------

I do:

>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install python3.6

Also, to compile you need the development headers. Do:

>sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev


Then install the dependencies listed in the readme:


``sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev``

``sudo apt install mesa-utils``

``sudo apt install clang``

``sudo apt install cmake``


you will also need

> sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
> sudo apt install freeglut3-dev
> sudo apt-get install libglew-dev



To run the install in DeepMimicCore:

If its a fresh installation of Ubuntu, you will also need a c++ compiler:

> sudo apt install build-essential

> sudo apt install git

then I fork and clone the DeepMimic repo

> git clone https://github.com/joanllobera/DeepMimic.git




~/DeepMimic/DeepMimicCore$ sudo ./build.sh 
Then:

(optional) to install anaconda

>  wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
>  bash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh


open a new terminal windows to load the conda .bash script
Then:


> conda create --name mimic1 python=3.6
> conda activate mimic1

and, following the README instructions, what is needed for the python packages:

(from now, mandatory:)
- MPI 

  - Linux: `sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev`


Python:

- Python 3
- PyOpenGL (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) 

``pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate``

- Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) ( Vesrion : 1.13.1 )

``pip install tensorflow==1.13.1`` 

- MPI4Py (https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

``pip install mpi4py``

And then, the runtime instruction, to test it works:

> python DeepMimic.py --arg_file args/run_humanoid3d_spinkick_args.txt
